# Source Materials
The following materials are modified from [Chapter 6](https://r.geocompx.org/raster-vector#raster-vector) of *Geocomputation with R* by Robin Lovelace.
:::

In this lab we'll explore operations that rely on interactions between vector and raster datasets, including how to convert raster data into vector data.

## 1. Set up

First, we'll load all relevant packages.
```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
library(sf) # vector handling
library(terra) # raster handling
library(tidyverse)
library(tmap) # map making
library(spData) # spatial data
library(spDataLarge) # spatial data
library(viridisLite)
```

Today we're heading back to Zion National Park in Utah to explore the interactions between vector and raster data.

:::

We'll load the following data from the `{spDataLarge}` package:

- `srtm.tif`: remotely sensed elevation estimates (raster data)
- `zion.gpkg`: boundary of Zion National Park (vector data)

```{r}
# load raster dataset
elevation <- rast(system.file("raster/srtm.tif", package = "spDataLarge"))

# load vector dataset (state boundary)
boundary <- read_sf(system.file("vector/zion.gpkg", package = "spDataLarge"))
```

:::{.callout-warning icon=true}
# Remember to check the CRS!

Whenever we work with multiple spatial datasets, we need check that the coordinate reference systems match. If they don't, we need to transform one to match the other.

```{r}
if (crs(elevation) == crs(boundary)) {
  print("CRS match" )
} else {
  warning("CRS do not match; updated to match.")
  
  # Transform data to match 
  boundary <- st_transform(boundary, crs = st_crs(elevation))
  
  }


```
:::


```{r}
tm_shape(elevation) + tm_raster(col.legend = tm_legend("Elevation (m)"))+ tm_shape(boundary) + 
  tm_borders(lwd = 2)

```


## 2. Raster cropping

Many geographic data projects involve integrating data from many different sources, such as remote sensing images (rasters) and administrative boundaries (vectors). Often the extent of input raster datasets is larger than the area of interest. In this case, raster cropping and masking are useful for unifying the spatial extent of input data. Both operations reduce object memory use and associated computational resources for subsequent analysis steps and may be a necessary preprocessing step when creating attractive maps involving raster data.

First, let's crop the extent of the elevation raster to match the extent of Zion's boundaries. Through this process, we eliminate grid cells that fall outside the extent of the park and reduce the size of the raster. To do so, we use the `terra::crop()` function.

```{r}
# Crop extent of elevation raster to match boundary
# Eliminate grid cells outside boundary and reduce grid cells
elev_cropped <- crop(elevation, boundary) # Crops to EXTENT of boundary

#tm_shape(elev_cropped) + tm_raster(col.legend = tm_legend("Elevation"))


```

Beyond matching the extent, we can also set the values of raster cells outside of the boundaries or the park to `NA` using `terra::mask()`.
```{r}
elev_masked <- mask(elevation, boundary) # cells outside vector are converted to NA
tm_shape(elev_masked) + tm_raster(col.legend = tm_legend("Elevation"))

```

Often, we will want to combine both cropping and masking to reduce the size of the raster as much as possible.

```{r}
# Crop + mask to only work with rasters inside vector extent
elevation_final <- mask(elev_cropped, boundary)
tm_shape(elevation_final) + tm_raster(col.legend = tm_legend("Elevation"))


```

In some cases, we may want to mask the raster cells **inside** of the boundaries (i.e. assign cells inside the park to `NA`). We can do so with `terra::mask()` by setting the argument `inverse = TRUE`.

```{r}
elevation_inv_masked <- mask(elev_cropped, boundary, inverse = T) # PREVENTS SPACES ALONG BOUNDARY

```


```{r}


map1 <- tm_shape(elevation) +
  tm_raster(col.legend = tm_legend_hide()) +
tm_shape(boundary) +
  tm_borders(lwd = 2) +
tm_title(text = "original")

map2 <- tm_shape(elev_cropped) +
  tm_raster(col.legend = tm_legend_hide()) +
tm_shape(boundary) +
  tm_borders(lwd = 2) +
tm_title(text =  "cropped")

map3 <- tm_shape(elev_masked) +
  tm_raster(col.legend = tm_legend_hide()) +
tm_shape(boundary) +
  tm_borders(lwd = 2) +
tm_title(text  = "masked")

map4 <- tm_shape(elevation_final) +
  tm_raster(col.legend = tm_legend_hide()) +
tm_shape(boundary) +
  tm_borders(lwd = 2) +
tm_title(text =  "cropped & masked")

map5 <- tm_shape(elevation_inv_masked) +
  tm_raster(col.legend = tm_legend_hide()) +
tm_shape(boundary) +
  tm_borders(lwd = 2) +
tm_title(text =  "inverse mask")

tmap_arrange(map1, map2, map3, map4, map5, nrow = 2)
```


## 3. Raster vectorization

There are several ways to convert raster data into vector. The most common, and straightforward, is converting raster grid cells into polygons. For more examples, check out [*Geocomputation with R*](https://r.geocompx.org/raster-vector#spatial-vectorization). 

We could simply convert all grid cells into polygons, but it may be more helpful to create polygons based on some condition

:::{.callout-tip icon=true}
# Tip for HW3

The following example is relevant to homework assignment 3!
:::

In this example, we'll select grid cells higher than 2000 meters by masking the elevation raster. We'll then convert these grid cells into polygons using the `terra::as.polygons()` function and turn this into a `sf` object.

```{r}
# Set all elevation values below 2000 to NA 
elev_masked <- mask(elevation, boundary)
elev_masked[elev_masked < 2000] <- NA # Still spatial, just now have NA for cell value 

# Convert high elevation values into polygons and then transform into a sf
elev_masked_poly <- as.polygons(elev_masked) %>% st_as_sf()

```



```{r}

map1 <- tm_shape(elev_masked) +
  tm_raster() +
  tm_title( text = "masked raster")+ 
  tm_layout(legend.position = c("left", "bottom"))

map2 <- tm_shape(elev_masked_poly) +
  tm_polygons() +
  tm_title(text = "vectorized raster")

tmap_arrange(map1, map2, nrow = 1)
```




### Rayshader 

[Rayshader](https://www.rayshader.com/) is an R package that creates beautiful 2D and 3D maps from elevation data. It uses various shading techniques to make terrain look realistic, including:

Lambertian shading - simulates direct sunlight on slopes
Ambient occlusion - adds shadows in valleys and crevices
Hypsometric tinting - colors based on elevation (greens for low, browns/whites for high)
Texture shading - emphasizes ridges and drainage patterns
Sphere shading - adds natural ambient lighting effects

These techniques can be layered together to create stunning, professional-quality terrain maps in just a few lines of code.


#### Road trip! We are headed northeast to Bryce Canyon National Park!We will use the `rayshader` package, as well as `osmdata`to visualize the hoodoos of Bryce Canyon in 3D. 


```{r}
#| message: false
#install.packages("rayshader")
#install.packages("magick")
#install.packages("osmdata")
library(rayshader)
library(magick)
library(osmdata)
library(raster)
```




```{r}
bryce = raster("week5/Bryce_Canyon_GeoTIFF/Bryce_Canyon.tif")

# Transform spatial data structure into raster
bryce_mat = raster_to_matrix(bryce)

# Reduce size
bryce_small = resize_matrix(bryce_mat,0.25)
```



#### Building Basemaps with Rayshader

```{r}
# Base map
bryce_small %>% 
  # Map colors to elevation values
  height_shade() %>%  
 # plot map
  plot_map() 
```

```{r}

bryce_small %>% 
  height_shade() %>% 
  # Adding desert colors
  add_overlay(sphere_shade(bryce_small, texture = "desert", 
                           zscale=4, colorintensity = 5), alphalayer=0.5) %>%
  
  # Add shadows for realistic appearance
  add_shadow(lamb_shade(bryce_small,zscale=6), 0) %>%
  

  add_shadow(ambient_shade(bryce_small), 0) %>%
  
  # add texture shading
  add_shadow(texture_shade(bryce_small,detail=8/10,contrast=9,brightness = 11), 0.1) %>%
  plot_map()
```



```{r}
# Establish utm coordinates.. define bounding box coordinates for area of interest (shrink bounding box)
utm_bbox <- c(xmin = 396367.4, xmax = 397975.2, 
              ymin = 4163747.9, ymax = 4165291.0)
```


```{r}
# Create extent object from bounding box coordinates
extent_zoomed = extent(utm_bbox[1], utm_bbox[2], utm_bbox[3], utm_bbox[4])

bryce_zoom = crop(bryce, extent_zoomed)

bryce_zoom_mat = raster_to_matrix(bryce_zoom)

base_map = bryce_zoom_mat %>% 
  height_shade() %>%
  add_overlay(sphere_shade(bryce_zoom_mat, texture = "desert", colorintensity = 5), alphalayer=0.5) %>%
  add_shadow(lamb_shade(bryce_zoom_mat), 0) %>%
  add_shadow(ambient_shade(bryce_zoom_mat),0) %>% 
  add_shadow(texture_shade(bryce_zoom_mat,detail=8/10,contrast=9,brightness = 11), 0.1)

plot_map(base_map)
```

#### Using OSM to add features to our base map

bryce_highway = opq(osm_bbox) %>% 
  add_osm_feature("highway") %>%
  osmdata_sf() 
bryce_highway
```



```{r}
# Transform OSM to match the CRS of Bryce
bryce_lines = st_transform(bryce_highway$osm_lines, crs=crs(bryce))

tm_shape(bryce_lines) +
  tm_lines(col = "black") +
  tm_title(text = "Open Street Map `highway` attribute in Bryce Canyon National Park")
```



```{r}
# Separate lines into trails, footpaths, and roads
bryce_trails = bryce_lines %>% 
  filter(highway %in% c("path","bridleway"))
